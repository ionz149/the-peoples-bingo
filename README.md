## 👷 Built With ...

Love but also Astro, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, lots of Google, and a tiny bit of ChatGPT.

## 🚧 The Future

- Larger source of quotes to incorporate some lobs to cut down on game time
- Highlight relevant column header letter when card is clicked
- Bonus section for Harvey, Douglas and Doug
