# 👩‍⚖️ The People's Bingo v0.8

## ⁉️ Why?

> 😖 **Why would you do this?**

I have built a version of bingo based on things Judge Marylin Millian says on The People's Court. In its current iteration you would need to watch quite a few episodes to get a win. Re-working of the quote pool is on the to-do list.

## 👷 Built With ...

Love but also Astro, HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, lots of Google, and a tiny bit of ChatGPT.

## 🚧 The Future

🔘 Larger source of quotes to incorporate some lobs to cut down on game time

🔘 Highlight relevant column header letter when card is clicked

🔘 Bonus section for Harvey, Douglas and Doug
