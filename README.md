# 👩‍⚖️ The People's Bingo v0.04

<!-- ```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
``` -->

## Why?

> 😖 **Why would you do this?**

I have built a version of bingo based on things Judge Marylin Millian says on The People's Court. In its current iteration you would need to watch quite a few episodes to get a win. Re-working of the quote pool is on the to-do list.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
