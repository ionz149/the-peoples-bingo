			<h2 id="dialog1Title">About this game</h2>
			<p id="dialog1Desc">This game is loosely based on bingo and was built as a means to better understand Javascript. My wife and I love watching People's Court re-runs and keep a running list of our favorite quotes. So this was a simple and fun way two merge to things I enjoy. Fire up YouTube, search for The People's Court, and watch a few episodes to try and get a bingo. Currently it would take many episodes to actually get a bingo.</p>
